In addressing Head Start&#8217;s need for information on children and their families, in depth  
data have been collected in a number of areas from a large, nationally representative  
sample of enrolled families.  Project  reports and papers  will contain more detailed  
descriptions of these families.  <textline bbox="300.960,484.755,419.108,512.739" colourspace="DeviceGray" font="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" ncolour="(0.2, 0.2, 0.8)" size="27.984">Summary </textline>

trained to help needy families get required services, help families move towards self-

over time.  Family change may be due to societal  factors  (e.g. welfare reform), typical  
family maturation (e.g., experience), or more extraordinary  family circumstances (e.g.,  
divorce, a parent completing school or a training program).   It is also possible that  
family or individual change is due to the efforts of Head Start. It will be our challenge
