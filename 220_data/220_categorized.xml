recent years, such as welfare reform and the diversification of the population  
served by Head Start.  This has been reflected in the changing population  
that is taking advantage of Federal services for families.  With these changes  
has come increased scrutiny of Federal programs providing services,  
including those designed for low-income families.  If the programs that  
serve low-income children and their families are to be responsive to the  
evolving portrait of the people they serve, new data are needed on a regular  
basis.  One goal of the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey  
(FACES) is to follow a national sample of Head Start families, to learn about  
the characteristics of these families, and to understand the challenges they  
face.  The value of  this information is in helping Head Start adapt policies  
and procedures to better fulfill its mission of assisting families in their own  
development as the primary nurturers of their children. <textline bbox="55.200,446.731,643.434,466.771" colourspace="DeviceGray" font="TimesNewRomanPSMT" ncolour="(0, 0.4, 1)" size="20.040">There has been a great degree of societal change brought on by events of  </textline>

over time.  Family change may be due to societal  factors  (e.g. welfare reform), typical  
family maturation (e.g., experience), or more extraordinary  family circumstances (e.g.,  
divorce, a parent completing school or a training program).   It is also possible that  
family or individual change is due to the efforts of Head Start. It will be our challenge
